# MyCV

This repo contains only my updated CV.
Why do this?
Because I'm not a CV writer, 
I'm a software developer.
I'm trying to improve it every day by fixing something or explaining better some other points so why don't treat it as a software project?

## CHANGELOG - Newest updates up
* 1.0.3 - Fix some typos
* 1.0.2 - Improve README, update description of repo
* 1.0.1 - Update README
* 1.0.0 - Add semantic versioning
